## Mustafa Abdullah Kus's README

**Mustafa Abdullah Kus - Software Developer Engineer**

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is the README for Mustafa Abdullah Kus, Software Developer Engineer in Sparse Technology. The purpose of this document is to, hopefully, give you some knowledge about me (both personal and professional), the way I work, and my personality before meeting me for the first time.

## Personally

- I was born in Konya, raised, and now currently live in Ankara, Turkey. Famous for [Rumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi), [Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk).
- I graduated from Suleyman Demirel University in Isparta in 2020 and studied [Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering). Creativity in software engineering is really important to me.
- Anyone (that means **you**) is welcome to reach out to me privately to discuss mental health issues at any time.
- I'm _super_ dubious about the value of personality tests, but apparently [I'm a Debater (ENTP-A)](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality).

## Professionally

* I started working at Sparse Technology in July 2020 (when literally _nothing_ else was going on in the world) and have been working in the core team ever since.
* I've been working actively in the industry from the last year of my education to till now.
* I've programmed TI Tiva 1294 and 123 processors, ESP, nRF52 series and STM32 F4 and H7 series MCUs.
* I've programmed on various real-time operating systems including FreeRTOS, RT-Thread, TI RTOS/SYSBIOS, Mbed OS, and Zephyr with those MCUs.
* I have extensive experience in programming communication peripherals like I2C, SPI, UART, and CAN.
* I'm well-versed in network communication protocols including UDP, TCP, MQTT, CoAP, and LwM2M.
* Recently, I ported an Embedded Linux product to a deeply embedded system, converting networking code from Linux to LWIP.
* I have broad experience with Embedded Linux, particularly on the Raspberry Pi and ARM-based platforms, including kernel customization and driver development.
* I employ debugging techniques such as breakpoints, serial tracing, JTAG debugging, and logic analyzers for troubleshooting embedded systems.
* I actively contribute to open-source projects, including [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amustafaabdullahk+),
where I maintain and develop drivers for embedded peripherals.
* My expertise extends beyond embedded systems to high-level software development in C++.
  * I have deep knowledge of Modern C++ (C++11/14/17) and apply best practices in memory management, multi-threading, and real-time performance optimization.
  * I have developed cross-platform applications using Qt and C++ for industrial and data acquisition systems.
  * I have experience in writing highly optimized, performance-critical applications, including those that require low-latency networking and large-scale data processing.
  * I integrate C++ with networking technologies like gRPC, Protocol Buffers, and REST APIs for scalable backend services.
  * I follow modern C++ design patterns and best practices to ensure maintainability and efficiency in complex software architectures.
* Writing software is what I love doing. I'm incredibly fortunate that the Venn diagram of "Things Mustafa likes to do" and "Skills that are in demand" are just two perfectly overlapping circles.

### What do I actually do?

My working days tend to contain the same sorts of tasks, just in a different order or balance.

* The majority of my daily work is _writing code_ in some form. Usually, this takes the form of feature development, improving system performance, or paying down technical debt.
* The rest of my time is spent **learning**, **mentoring**, and **spending time socially with my colleagues.**

## What I assume about others

* Everyone has something to teach me. Sometimes, but not always, I have something to teach them.
* [Everyone is intelligent and well-meaning.](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review#everyone)
* You are excellent at what you do.

## Communicating with me

* I'm _always_ available for coffee chats. **Don't be shy, add a coffee chat to my calendar.**
* In general, I prefer Slack over Email for anything that doesn't belong in an Issue or Merge Request. I will often mark my email inbox as read and pick up tasks from my GitLab todo list.
* **Don't hesitate to ask me anything.** If I can help, I will! For a quick response, find me on Slack during my working hours.

## Things I'm trying to improve

* I'm not great at reading between the lines as a way of accepting criticism or constructive feedback. **If something is wrong, please say so.** I will thank you for it!
* I can sometimes act too much like a magpie; paying too much attention to the "new and shiny" things and not enough to the "older but more reliable" things.

## Finding me

You can find me in various places both on GitHub and online.

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafaabdullahk/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mustafabdullahk)

Non-employees can drop me an email (mustafa.kus@sparsetechnology.com) and I'll try to respond as quickly as possible.
